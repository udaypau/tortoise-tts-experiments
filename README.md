# Tortoise TTS - Voice Cloning Samples

This repository contains a few `.wav` samples generated using [Tortoise TTS](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts), a high-quality text-to-speech system capable of realistic voice cloning.

These samples were created during my personal exploration of speech synthesis and generative audio tools, focusing on:
- Testing different conditioning voices and prompts
- Understanding the capabilities and limitations of the model
- Experimenting with reproducibility and inference parameters


## ðŸ“œ Credits

This project builds on the excellent work of [@neonbjb](https://github.com/neonbjb), the creator of [Tortoise TTS](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).  
All voice generation was done using his model, and I take no credit for the original architecture or code.
